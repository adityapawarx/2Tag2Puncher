## Introduction

TagPuncher is a system developed to automatically generate relevant tags for content, focusing on academic documents. It aims to enhance content discoverability and reduce information overload in large repositories by providing accurate and contextually relevant tags.

## Problem Statement

Traditional folksonomies, often relying on manual tagging, face several limitations, including:

* **Synonymy:** Different terms used to describe the same concept.
* **Polysemy:** The same term having multiple meanings.
* **Sparsity:** A lack of sufficient tags for certain content.

These challenges hinder effective content retrieval and management in large digital libraries and academic repositories.

## Approach

TagPuncher proposes a hybrid approach combining both statistical and semantic methods to overcome the limitations of traditional tagging. This methodology aims to generate tags that are more accurate and contextually relevant than purely statistical or semantic methods alone.

## Repository Contents

* `TagPuncher_Reseach_Paper_on_Reverse_Folksonomy.pdf`: The research paper detailing the problem, proposed solution (TagPuncher), methodology, and findings.
* `main_ipynb.pdf`: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code implementation, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps for the TagPuncher project.

## Getting Started

To get a full understanding of the project, it is recommended to read the `TagPuncher_Reseach_Paper_on_Reverse_Folksonomy.pdf` first.

While `main_ipynb.pdf` provides the code, it is a static PDF. To run and interact with the code, you would typically need to:

1.  Set up a Python environment (e.g., using `conda` or `venv`).
2.  Install necessary libraries (likely including `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`, `gensim`, etc.).
3.  Have access to the original `.ipynb` file and any associated datasets.

## Usage

The `main_ipynb.pdf` provides an overview of the code's functionality, which includes:

* Data loading and preprocessing steps.
* Implementation of statistical and semantic tagging algorithms.
* Methods for combining hybrid approaches.
* Procedures for evaluating the generated tags.

## Evaluation

The project evaluates the effectiveness of the proposed TagPuncher system in generating accurate and relevant tags. The research paper likely contains detailed evaluation metrics and results. The Jupyter Notebook (main_ipynb.pdf) illustrates the code used for these evaluations.
